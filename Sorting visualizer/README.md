# Sorting Visualizer

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms. This tool provides a visual representation of various sorting techniques to help users understand how they operate.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in this application:

1. **Bubble Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Insertion Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Quick Sort**
6. **Heap Sort**

## Features

1. **Colored Representation of Sorting Steps:**
    - **Blue:** Default state, indicating unsorted data.
    - **Yellow:** Elements currently being compared.
    - **Red:** Elements identified as being in an incorrect position and needing to be moved.
    - **Green:** Elements in their correct, sorted position.

2. **Controls for Visualization:**
    - **Speed of Visualization:** Allows users to adjust the speed of the sorting animation. Five different speed levels are available.
    - **Data Size:** Users can adjust the size of the dataset to be sorted.
    - **Generate New Data:** Randomly generate new datasets for sorting.

3. **Complexity Analysis:**
    - Displays the **Time Complexity** and **Space Complexity** of the currently selected sorting algorithm.
